/*
 *  @title IVault
 *
 *  @notice The standard interface for a generic vault as described by the "Vault Framework".
 *          http://thinking.farm/essays/2022-10-05-mechanical-finance/
 *
 *          Users deposit a "underlying" asset and mint "notes" (or vault shares).
 *          The vault "deploys" underlying asset in a rules-based fashion (through a hard-coded strategy)
 *          to "earn" income. It "recovers" deployed assets once the investment matures.
 *
 *          The vault operates through two external poke functions which off-chain keepers can execute.
 *              1) `deploy`: When executed, the vault "puts to work" the underlying assets it holds. The vault
 *                           usually returns other ERC-20 tokens which act as receipts of the deployment.
 *              2) `recover`: When executed, the vault turns in the receipts and retrieves the underlying asset and
 *                            usually collects some yield for this work.
 *
 *          The rules of the deployment and recovery are specific to the vault strategy.
 *
 *          At any time the vault will hold multiple ERC20 tokens, together referred to as the vault's "assets".
 *          They can be a combination of the underlying asset, the earned asset and the deployed assets (receipts).
 *
 *          On redemption users burn their "notes" to receive a proportional slice of all the vault's assets.
